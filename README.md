AirBnB Clone - Command Line Interface

The AirBnB clone project seeks to deploy a simplified version of the AirBnB website on a server. Below are the outlined steps for the project, focusing on the Command Line Interface (CLI):

The Console:

Design the data model.
Develop a command interpreter for data manipulation through a console.
Implement storage and object persistence using a JSON file.
Web Static:

Learn HTML/CSS.
Create HTML templates for the application.
Make static HTML files dynamic by integrating data from files or databases.
MySQL Storage:

Replace the file storage system with a database storage solution.
Map models to database tables using an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM).
Web Framework - Templating:

Build a Python web server using a web framework.
Render dynamic HTML templates by fetching data from files or databases.
RESTful API:

Create a JSON web interface (API) for exposing and manipulating stored objects.
Implement CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on objects through the API.
Web Dynamic:

Learn JQuery.
Load objects dynamically from the client-side using the RESTful API.
The command interpreter in the AirBnB clone project functions as a tool for manipulating data without a visual interface, resembling a Shell. It enables interaction with the application's functionality and facilitates various actions.

Getting Started with the Command Interpreter:

How to start the command interpreter:

Open the terminal.
Navigate to the directory where the project files are located.
Run the "console.py" file to initiate the command interpreter.
How to use the command interpreter:
Once the command interpreter is active, enter commands to interact with the application. The interpreter recognizes a set of predefined commands, allowing you to manipulate data and perform actions within the application. Here are some examples:

Creating a new User instance (command prompt): create User
Displaying all instances of a specific class (command prompt): all User (replace "User" with the appropriate class name)
Displaying all instances across all classes (command prompt): all
